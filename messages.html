            <p class="card-text">Hey Sonia, Happy 15th month to you! It has really been such a tough few months having to be separated from you for so long but I knew we would make it through and we did! Good job and thank you for sticking with and supporting me through these times. Even though we are physically apart, I still do feel I have grown closer to you and more connected too! I’m glad we managed to do activities such as exercising together and always staying in touch with each other. Thank you for being my support during PES C BMT and I know it definitely wasn’t easy at all so I want you to know that I am so grateful for everything you have done for me. Taking the effort to bake, cook, and deliver food to me really touches my heart and I always feel so blessed to be loved by you. Thank you for taking the time to write me letters and even paint such a beautiful painting for me that foreshadows our road trip one day too hehe! Once again, thank you for always taking care of me all the time and making me the happiest. </p>
            <p class="card-text">I love you so much! I never want to lose you and I promise to take care of you and love you the best I can! I hope I will be able to live up to these standards :) I can’t wait to take your hand and call you my wife hehe <3 </p>

            <p class="card-text">Hey there Sonia!</p>
            <p class="card-text">Not sure if you’ll see this but I saw your Instagram stories yesterday and I’m guessing it’s the last day of M4 for you. Congratulations on completing M4! That’s definitely a massive milestone and yet another large step taken in life! I know you’re probably really stressed about your exams starting in a few days but if it helps, everyone is in the same boat and more likely than not feeling the same way as well; so just know that you’re never alone and reach out to your friends when you’re feeling especially in need of company and support! </p>
            <p class="card-text">Last but not least, I just wanted you to know that I’m so incredibly proud of you for getting through this academic year and achieving yet another milestone in your life! I know it has definitely not been an easy one (very much more so because of me and I sincerely apologise for doing so) which makes this another testament to how strong and amazing of a person you are. </p>
            <p class="card-text">All the best for your upcoming exams, it’ll no doubt be difficult but do your very best and enjoy the fun that comes after (thinking about results can wait till they come out)!</p>
            <p class="card-text">Take care of yourself and don’t forget to eat well and drink more water! I got you some snacks which I hope will help tide you through this stressful exam period. Hope to see you soon (even if it might be for the last time). Stay happy and true to yourself always!</p>
            <p class="card-text">Still thinking about you, missing you and loving you always!</p>
            <p class="card-text">Yours Truly, Luke</p>
